# `messypoutine`

Created by [BoostSecurity.io](https://boostsecurity.io), `poutine` is a security scanner that detects misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in the build pipelines of a repository. It supports parsing CI workflows from GitHub Actions and Gitlab CI/CD. When given an access token with read-level access, `poutine` can analyze all the repositories of an organization to quickly gain insights into the security posture of the organization's software supply chain.

See the [documentation](docs/content/en/rules) for a list of rules currently supported by `poutine`.

## Why `poutine`?

In French, the word "poutine", when not referring to the [dish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poutine), can be used to mean "messy". Inspired by the complexity and intertwined dependencies of modern open-source projects, `poutine` reflects both a nod to our Montreal roots and the often messy, complex nature of securing software supply chains.

## Supported Platforms

- GitHub Actions
- Gitlab Pipelines
- Azure DevOps
- Pipelines As Code Tekton

--verbose        Enable debug logging
```

See [.poutine.sample.yml](.poutine.sample.yml) for an example configuration file.

### Custom Rules

`poutine` supports custom Rego rules to extend its security scanning capabilities. You can write your own rules and include them at runtime.

#### Configuration

Create a `.poutine.yml` configuration file in your current working directory, or use a custom path with the `--config` flag:

```bash
poutine analyze_local . --config my-config.yml
```

In your configuration file, specify the path(s) to your custom rules using the `include` directive:

```yaml
include:
  - path: ./custom_rules
  - path: ./github_actions
```

#### Writing Custom Rules

Custom Rego rules must:
1. Be saved as `*.rego` files in the included directory
2. Follow the package naming convention: `package rules.<rule_name>`
3. Define a `rule` variable with metadata
4. Define a `results` set containing findings

**Example custom rule:**

```rego
package rules.custom_injection

import data.poutine
import rego.v1

# METADATA
# title: Custom Injection Detection
# description: Detects potential injection vulnerabilities in workflows
# custom:
#   level: warning

rule := poutine.rule(rego.metadata.chain())

# Define pattern to detect (properly escaped for Rego)
patterns.github contains `\\$\\{\\{[^\\}]+\\}\\}`

results contains poutine.finding(rule, pkg.purl, {
  "path": workflow.path,
  "line": step.lines.run,
  "job": job.id,
  "step": i,
  "details": "Potential injection found in step",
}) if {
  pkg := input.packages[_]
  workflow := pkg.github_actions_workflows[_]
  job := workflow.jobs[_]
  step := job.steps[i]
  step.run  # Ensure step has a run command
  regex.match(patterns.github[_], step.run)
}
```

**Key points:**
- Use `import data.poutine` and `import rego.v1` for modern Rego syntax and poutine utilities
- Use `rule := poutine.rule(rego.metadata.chain())` to extract metadata from METADATA comments
- The `package` name determines the rule identifier (e.g., `package rules.custom_injection` â†’ rule ID: `custom_injection`)
- Add METADATA comments to describe the rule with `title`, `description`, and `level`
- Set the severity `level` to `note`, `warning`, or `error`
- Use `poutine.finding(rule, pkg.purl, {...})` to create findings that match the poutine schema
- The `results` set should contain findings with fields like `path`, `line`, `job`, `step`, `details`

For more examples, see:
- [poutine-rules repository](https://github.com/boost-rnd/poutine-rules) - External rule examples
- Built-in rules in [opa/rego/rules/](./opa/rego/rules/) directory
- [.poutine.sample.yml](.poutine.sample.yml) - Configuration examples

### Acknowledging Findings

`poutine` supports skipping (acknowledging) specific findings that are not relevant in your context. This can be useful when:
- A finding is a false positive
- The security concern has been addressed through other means (e.g., hardened self-hosted runners)
- You've accepted the risk for a particular finding

To acknowledge findings, you can either:
1. Add a `skip` section to your `.poutine.yml` configuration file
2. Use the `--skip` command-line flag (e.g., `--skip rule_name`) for one-time skipping

#### Configuration File

Add a `skip` section to your `.poutine.yml` configuration file. Each skip rule can filter findings by:
- `job`: Filter by job name
- `level`: Filter by severity level (note, warning, error)
- `path`: Filter by workflow file path
- `rule`: Filter by rule name
- `purl`: Filter by package URL
- `osv_id`: Filter by OSV ID

Example configuration:

```yaml
skip:
  # Skip all note-level findings
  - level: note

  # Skip findings in a specific workflow
  - path: .github/workflows/safe.yml

  # Skip a specific rule everywhere
  - rule: unpinnable_action

  # Skip a rule for specific workflows
  - rule: pr_runs_on_self_hosted
    path:
      - .github/workflows/pr.yml
      - .github/workflows/deploy.yml

  # Skip findings for specific packages
  - rule: github_action_from_unverified_creator_used
    purl:
      - pkg:githubactions/dorny/paths-filter
```

For more examples, see [.poutine.sample.yml](.poutine.sample.yml).

#### Command Line

You can also skip rules on the command line using the `--skip` flag. Note that the command-line flag only supports skipping rules by name globally and does not support the granular filtering options (job, path, level, etc.) available in the configuration file.

```bash
# Skip a single rule globally
poutine analyze_repo org/repo --skip unpinnable_action

# Skip multiple rules globally
poutine analyze_repo org/repo --skip unpinnable_action --skip pr_runs_on_self_hosted
```

This is useful for one-time analysis or when you want to temporarily ignore specific rules without modifying your configuration file. For more granular control (e.g., skipping a rule only in specific workflows), use the configuration file instead.

## AI Coding Assistant Integration (MCP)

`poutine` can be integrated with AI coding assistants like Claude Code, Gemini, etc. through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This allows AI assistants to analyze repositories and validate CI/CD pipelines directly from your development environment.

For detailed setup instructions for your specific AI coding tool, see the [MCP Integration Guide](MCP_INTEGRATION.md).

## Building from source

Building `poutine` requires Go 1.25+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/boostsecurityio/poutine.git
cd poutine
make build
```

## Development
### Updating Build Platform CVE Database
```bash
go test -tags build_platform_vuln_database ./...

For examples of vulnerabilities in GitHub Actions workflows, you can explore the [Messy poutine GitHub organization](https://github.com/messypoutine). It showcases real-world vulnerabilities from open-source projects readily exploitable for educational purposes. 

To get started with some hints, try using `poutine` to analyze the `messypoutine` organization:
``` bash
